**NOTE: Items marked `jdkxx` and `TEMPLATE_UPDATEME` should be replaced while deploying this issue template. It is recommended to delete this line once you've done so :-)**

This Temurin release checklist based on the [release doc](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/RELEASING.md) captures what activities must happen during a release.  

The target release date is: _________

The release champion for this release is: _________

Planned absences during the release cycle:

The role of the release champion is to ensure that all release activities listed in this checklist get completed (by delegation to the broader team or by the release champion themselves).  The final task of the release champion during a release is to confirm that all items in the checklist were completed satisfactorily and the release can be declared complete.

Everyone participating in a release, including the release champion are requested to provide feedback into the release retrospective so that the release process can be continuously improved (through simplification and/or automation).

-------

### Two Weeks Prior To Release

- [ ] **Release Champion named** whose responsibility is to ensure every item in this checklist gets completed
- [ ] **Release Checklist Created**  Create this issue to track the release and the preparation tasks.
- [ ] **Identify Expected Release Versions** - Find out the version numbers from [here](https://www.java.com/releases/)
- [ ] **Check/update temurin-build NOTICE file template source repository list** (https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/5c7ebf540e2ee298392acc362f0a1f705a0695a2/sbin/NOTICE.template#L41)
- [ ] **Issue Code Freeze Early Warning For None Branched Repos**

Paste a message similar to the example below In the Adoptium [build](https://adoptium.slack.com/archives/C09NW3L2J)  and  [release](https://adoptium.slack.com/archives/CLCFNV2JG) slack channels

> In preparation for the upcoming release cycle, Im proposing to perform
> a code freeze on the following repositories on "Release Date - 7" (1 week prior to release)
>
> - [github-release-scripts](https://github.com/adoptium/github-release-scripts)
> - [containers](https://github.com/adoptium/containers)
> - [installer](https://github.com/adoptium/installer)
>
> Please ensure any PRs required for the release are merged before the (DATE).

- [ ] **Create Release Branches**
create branches in the following adoptium source repositories :-
		[temurin-build](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build)
		[ci-jenkins-pipelines](https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines)
		[jenkins-helper](https://github.com/adoptium/jenkins-helper)

These branches should be named according to the following format (vYYYY.MM.NN) ,e.g v2023.03.01 , whereby the final element is an incremental counter appended to the year and month of the release.

 - [ ] **Identify the aqa branch name for the upcoming release**
 - [ ] TC: Run the ProcessCheckMultiNode process cleaning job on all ci.role.test nodes, to ensure healthy state, verify all nodes successful: https://ci.eclipse.org/temurin-compliance/job/ProcessCheckMultiNode/build?delay=0sec
 - [ ] TC: Run the Setup_JCK_Run_Multinode job with CLEAN_DIR=true (to purge any old release contents/results) on all ci.role.test nodes, this will extract the jck_run folder with all the temurin.jtx exclude files, verify all nodes successful : https://ci.eclipse.org/temurin-compliance/job/Setup_JCK_Run_Multinode/build?delay=0sec

 - [ ] **Check the nagios server to ensure there are no critical infrastructure issues**
	 Log in to the public [nagios](https://nagios.adoptopenjdk.net/nagios/) server, and check the Problems / Services page. If you do not have access, please request it via an issue in the infrastructure repository. If there are any issues, then please log an issue in the infrastructure repository.
 - [ ] **Regenerate The Release Build Pipeline Jobs In Jenkins**
 - [ ] **Prepare & Perform Dry Run Of Build & Tests**

>  - Identify the relevent aqa-tests branch version
>  - Update releaseVersions with "dry run test" release versions.
>  - Update https://github.com/adoptium/mirror-scripts/blob/master/releasePlan.cfg
> with expected tags ( again amended appropriately for a dry run ), for more detail see
> https://github.com/zdtsw/mirror-scripts/tree/issue/3167#skara-repos-and-processes
>  - Update The AQA Branch ( e.g. ) https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/v0.9.6-release/testenv/testenv.properties with the expected tags.


### One Week Prior To Release
- [ ] **Final Code Freeze Warning** post a message similar to below to the build & release slack channels

>  In Preparation for next weeks release, I'm proposing to tag the
> following repositories ( this is instead of a code freeze ), in order
> that this tag becomes the baseline for the release. Shout now if you
> need to get any PRs merged ahead of the release, as today is the last
> day, the following repositories will be tagged ( temurin-build,
> ci-jenkins-pipelines , jenkins-helper, mirror-scripts ).

After 1 day, then :-

- [ ] **Declare code freeze** to ensure stability of build systems and infrastructure during release process. This is done by pasting the below message into the #release channel in Slack:

<details>
<summary>Code Freeze message</summary>

With under a week to go until releases, we are entering a lockdown period for the following repositories: <a href='https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/pulls'>temurin-build</a>, <a href='https://github.com/adoptium/ci-jenkins-pipelines/pulls'>ci-jenkins-pipelines</a>, <a href='https://github.com/adoptium/github-release-scripts/pulls'>github-release-scripts</a>, <a href='https://github.com/adoptium/containers/pulls'>containers</a>, <a href='https://github.com/adoptium/installer/pulls'>installer</a>.
If you need to submit a pr for any of these repos during this period, you should:
  <ul>
  <li>Add a comment saying “Approval to merge during the lockdown cycle please” and post in the appropriate slack channel for awareness. This can be done before the PR is finalised</li>
  <li>Add a note into this channel saying you are requesting the approval with a link to the comment in the first bullet point</li>
  <li>The comment should have approval from at least one build committer and one PMC member to indicate that they agree it is critical that it goes in</li>
  <li>The PR can be merged after 2 hours of the post going into the build channel (to give people time to object ... This delay may be skipped in the case where the delay will result in something breaking within that time.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

 - [ ] **Enable code freeze bot** In order to enable the code freeze GitHub you need to change the line `if: github.repository_owner == 'adoptium' && false` to be `if: github.repository_owner == 'adoptium' && true` in the [code-freeze.yml](https://github.com/adoptium/.github/blob/main/.github/workflows/code-freeze.yml#L21) GitHub workflow. Please contact the PMC if you need help merging this change.
 - [ ] **Freeze The Non Tagged Repositories** implement code freeze on the following repositories : 		
	 - github-release-scripts https://github.com/adoptium/github-release-scripts
	 - containers https://github.com/adoptium/containers
	 - installer https://github.com/adoptium/installer
	 - mirror-scripts https://github.com/adoptium/mirror-scripts

- [ ] **Disable standard & evaluation nightly builds completely** by disabling the pipelines temporarily to free up resources and ensure no competing jobs during release week. This should be done by setting the default for ENABLE_PIPELINE_SCHEDULE to false in the [https://ci.adoptium.net/job/build-scripts/job/utils/job/build-pipeline-generator/](https://ci.adoptium.net/job/build-scripts/job/utils/job/build-pipeline-generator/), and then re-running it.
- [ ] **Disable standard & evaluation weekend builds completely** by disabling the pipelines temporarily to free up resources and ensure no competing jobs during the weekend prior to release, helps ensure no long running weekend jobs take critical resources during the beginning of the release period. This should be done by setting the default for ENABLE_PIPELINE_SCHEDULE to false in the [https://ci.adoptium.net/job/build-scripts/job/utils/job/build-pipeline-generator/](https://ci.adoptium.net/job/build-scripts/job/utils/job/build-pipeline-generator/), and then re-running it.
- [ ] **Update aqaReference** to update with new git branch for 'aqaReference' to be used in release pipeline: https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/branches (branch name to use should match the name of the [latest aqa-tests release](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/releases/latest))
 - [ ] **Prepare For Release**
>  - Double check the relevent aqa-tests branch version, ensure git branch for 'aqaReference' to be used in release pipeline: https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/branches (branch name to use should match the name of the [latest aqa-tests release](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/releases/latest))
>  - Update releaseVersions with release versions.
>  - Update https://github.com/adoptium/mirror-scripts/blob/master/releasePlan.cfg
> with expected tags, for more detail see
> https://github.com/zdtsw/mirror-scripts/tree/issue/3167#skara-repos-and-processes
- [ ] Generate release pipeline jobs for the new build scripts repo release tag, helper repo release tag and aqaReference: https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/build-scripts/job/utils/job/release-build-pipeline-generator/build?delay=0sec

**Wait For All Of The Above To Complete Successfully Before Proceeding!**

- [ ] Log a helpdesk ticket with EF , to get all test materials updated
- [ ] TC: Run the ProcessCheckMultiNode process cleaning job on all ci.role.test nodes, to ensure healthy state, verify all nodes successful: https://ci.eclipse.org/temurin-compliance/job/ProcessCheckMultiNode/build?delay=0sec
- [ ] TC: Run the Setup_JCK_Run_Multinode job with CLEAN_DIR=true (to purge any old release contents/results) on all ci.role.test nodes, this will extract the jck_run folder with all the temurin.jtx exclude files, verify all nodes successful : https://ci.eclipse.org/temurin-compliance/job/Setup_JCK_Run_Multinode/build?delay=0sec
- [ ] Check the nagios server to ensure there are no critical infrastructure issues
- [ ] **Trigger a trial release pipeline dry-run** to ensure less surprises on release day (typically against a milestone build), see here for [details](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/RELEASING.md#auto-way---before-release-week-auto-test)

- [ ] Confirm successful trial release pipelines and successful jck completion
- [ ] Calculate the "expected" openjdk build tags for the releases being published, and update all the JDKnn_BRANCH values in the testenv.properties file for the aqa-tests release branch, eg: https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/blob/v0.9.6-release/testenv/testenv.properties

-------

Release Week Checklist:

- [ ] **Add website banner** (this is done by making a PR then it gets automate published to website) - Announce that we target releases to be available within 48-72 hours of the GA tags being available
- [ ]   -- Check All Nodes Online https://ci.eclipse.org/temurin-compliance/label/ci.role.test/
- [ ]  Run https://ci.eclipse.org/temurin-compliance/job/ProcessCheckMultiNode/ -- with defaults
- [ ] Run Setup_JCK_Multinode with CLEAN_DIR=true for ( ci.role.test )
- [ ] Disable Setup JCK_MUltinode To Ensure Test Evidence Is Not Lost
- [ ] As detailed earlier, again check the nagios server to ensure there are no critical infrastructure issues
- [ ] Create the Github Issues for tracking progress against each Java version
- [ ] Create the Github issues for the Adoptium public retro & TC retroes
- [ ] Update the links on the slack channel for the release status and retrospective issues.

#### Release Day Onwards

- [ ] **Check Tags have been released upstream** - Look for mailing list announcements and `-ga` tags in version control.
- [ ] Check the published GA tags are the "expected" tags entered in the aqa-tests release branch testenv.properties. If they are not then update.
- [ ] **Check Tags have been Mirrored** [Mirrors](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/git-mirrors/job/git-mirrors/job/adoptium/).
- [ ] **Check "auto-trigger" pipelines or Launch build pipelines** for each version being released. Verify if the release pipline "auto-triggered", if not (maybe expected tag was wrong), then manually launch [(as per release doc](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin-build/blob/master/RELEASING.md#steps-for-every-version)) once release tags are available via [launch page](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/build-scripts/job/openjdk8-pipeline/build) in Jenkins.  Provide links in this issue to each version's pipeline build(s). There may be multiple pipelines per version if primary and secondary platforms are separated to expedite the release.  In some cases,  where there are unforeseen configuration or infrastructure issues, reruns may be needed.
  - jdk8 pipeline(s):
    - **primary jdk8 pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
    - **secondary jdk8 pipeline:**
      - reruns(s):
  - jdk11 pipeline(s):
    - **primary jdk11 pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
    - **secondary jdk11 pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
  - jdkxx pipeline(s):
    - **primary jdkxx pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
    - **secondary jdkxx pipeline:**
      - rerun(s):
- [ ] **Check Upstream Tags, Mirror Tags & Trigger Builds For JDK8 AARCH32** This specific version is built from a separate mirror repository and has a separate build process, this is CURRENTLY not part of the automation which is handled for the other platforms and version. Also note that there is a seperate properties file (testenv_arm32.properties) which needs to be updated.
- [ ] **Add links to the [status doc](https://github.com/adoptium/adoptium/issues/TEMPLATE_UPDATEME)** to indicate per-platform builds ready
- [ ] **Summarize test results**.  Find each launched build pipeline in [TRSS](https://trss.adoptium.net/) to view a summary of test results.  Can use the Release Summary Report feature in TRSS to generate a summary of failures, history and possible issues in markup format to be added to this issue as a comment.
- [ ] **Triage** each build and test failure in the release summary report (following the [Triage guidelines](https://github.com/adoptium/aqa-tests/blob/master/doc/Triage.md)) and determine blocking or non-blocking.  Supply links to triage issues or docs for each version here.
  - jdk8 triage summary:
  - jdk11 triage summary:
  - jdk17 triage summary:
  - jdkXX triage summary:
- [ ] **Fix** blocking failures if they exist and confirm others are non-blocking.
- [ ] **Confirm Temurin-compliance items completed**, per platform/version/binaryType
- [ ] **Get PMC 'ready to publish' approval**, once no blocking failures exist.
- [ ] **Generate The Release Notes Per JDK Version **, ( Use https://ci.adoptium.net/job/create_release_notes/ )
- [ ] **Publish the release** (run the restricted access [release tool job](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/job/build-scripts/job/release/job/refactor_openjdk_release_tool/) on Jenkins) ( also publish release notes )
- [ ] **Verify binaries published successfully** to github releases repo and website (_automate_*, this could also be an automated test)

- [ ] **Publish updates to the containers to dockerhub**
- [ ] **Edit the [Homebrew Temurin Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/temurin.rb)** and replace the version and sha256 as appropriate.  This means for Homebrew users that they install the latest by default and can use the `@` notation to install older versions if they wish.
- [ ] **Update support page** (_automate_* github workflow to create a PR to update [support webpage](https://github.com/adoptium/website-v2/blob/main/src/asciidoc-pages/support.adoc))
- [ ] **Update release notes** (_automate_* - github workflow to create update for [release notes page](https://adoptium.net/release_notes.html))
- [ ] **Trigger linux installers pipeline** currently it is part of the build pipelines (will eventually be updated to run independently)
- [ ] **Publicize the release** via Slack #release channel and Twitter (can be partially automated)
- [ ] **Declare code freeze end** opening up the code for further development
- [ ] **Disable code freeze bot** In order to enable the code freeze GitHub you need to change the line `if: github.repository_owner == 'adoptium' && true` to be `if: github.repository_owner == 'adoptium' && false` in the [code-freeze.yml](https://github.com/adoptium/.github/blob/main/.github/workflows/code-freeze.yml#L21) GitHub workflow. Please contact the PMC if you need help merging this change.
- [ ] **Remove website banner** (_automate_* via github workflow in website repository)
- [ ] **Check for presence of jdk8u aarch32 GA tag and mirror it** [Mercurial repo](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/aarch32-port/jdk8u) - [Mirror job](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/git-mirrors/job/git-mirrors/job/adoptium/job/git-hg-aarch32-jdk8u/)
- [ ] **Do all of the above for the jdk8u/aarch32 build**
- [ ] **Declare the release complete** and close this issue
