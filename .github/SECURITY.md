Report security vulnerability by emailing the Eclipse Security Team at security@eclipse.org.

## Disclosure Policy

Disclosure is initially limited to the reporter and all Eclipse Committers, but is expanded to include other individuals, and the general public. The timing and manner of disclosure is governed by the [Eclipse Security Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php).

Publicly disclosed issues are listed on the [Disclosed Vulnerabilities Page](https://www.eclipse.org/security/known.php).
